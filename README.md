# effective-octo-portal
Just a small model of a student-teacher portal

So..., looking at the files and folders in the effective-octo-portal repository, this project is a Django project with absolutely only 5% CSS and no Javascript, It is solely backend intended.
The brain of the project is in the base folder, where I start to link to the students and the lecturers folder.
The lecturers and students folders contains only the files that would be needed while coding for any of the two, for instance the view, the templates and any other python files that is needed to make the student page work is in the students folder, same goes for the lecturers folder.
The project has 3 applications, and you might have guessed them; base, lecturers, and students.
The CSS would be coming soon, this project came up while I was trying to widen my knowledge and skills with Python.
